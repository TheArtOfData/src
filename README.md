# [TheArtOfData](https://theartofdata.tech/)

Hello everyone, welcome on our GitHub repo! We'd like to introduce you to our project, TheArtOfData.
TheArtOfData is an online platform, which has two main features at the moment:
  - data plotting on charts
  - project (tutorial) creation

We've developed both features with the goal of being easily shareable. In fact, we're focusing on social sharing of charts and projects, and we hope that in the future we can add many other sharing options.

## Data plotting

By simply creating an account on our platform, you'll have access to the dashboard. The dashboard is the main section where you
can create a channel, interact with charts, create projects ecc.

By creating a channel, you can bind to it different types of data, both suggested (temperature, humidity, ecc.) and your custom data type. The data plotting feature offers two way of data uploading: manual (via form input) or automatic (via our APIs).

Inside the created channel, even while your data are being uploaded, you can create charts and bind them to one of the data types you defined for the channel. Done that, you are ready to see your data plotted on the charts!

## Projects

The other feature we offer is the creation of projects. Projects are intended to be some sort of tutorials, organized into steps, where you can explain how you realized something. 
You can also insert images or embed videos to support your explanation.
